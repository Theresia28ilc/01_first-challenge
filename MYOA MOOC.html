        <p>I just love cattle! They enjoy a mental challenge and, just like humans, they become excited when they solve problems. Cows understand the relationship between cause and effect and have been known to unlock their stalls when no one is watching!</p>

        <h2>highlandlover_72</h2>
        <p>Me too! Especially Scottish Highland Cattles. Similarly to wolf packs, cow herds have complex social dynamics. Each cow is able to recognize more than 50 members in a herd and relationships are important. Alpha cows are nominated for their intelligence, curiosity, self-confidence, and experience while brawny, selfish and pushy cows are generally not elected by the herd for leadership.</p>

        <p>yeah, they are just too cute. Cows enjoy loving touch such as a belly rub or ear scratch. They appreciate praise and affection. Cows can even learn to trust humans again after being abused. They are just incredible.</p>
